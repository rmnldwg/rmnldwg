# Hey, I'm Roman 👋

I am a PhD student in the departement of physics at the University of Zurich. My research interests revolve around probabilistic modelling in medical physics (radiation oncology mostly).

## 📚🔍 Research fields

In our main project, we try to model the risk for metastases in the lymph system of patients with squamous cell carcinomas in the head & neck region. You can read more on that in an excellent paper by a PostDoc in our group: [Pouymayou *et al*](https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6560/ab2a18). You can also check out our code for the [lymph model](https://lymph-model.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), which is a python package containing the code to learn and compute this risk of lymphatic metastases using **Bayesian networks** (mentioned paper) and also - this is new - **hidden Markov models** (new paper that was recently accepted, stay tuned for that!).

Another project deals with optimal fractionation schemes. Fractionation is the splitting of a prescribed dose of radiation designed to kill cancer cells in a tumor into multiple sessions to allow the healthy parts of the body to recover better. Innovative technologies like the [MR-LinAc](https://viewray.com/mri-guided-roar/) at our institution enable us to tackle this problem with **reinforcement learning**

## 🔭 Topics I'm interested in

* probabilistic models
* interpretable machine learning methods
* statistical learning theory

and also (though not necessarily research-related)

* 🌌 (theoretical) astrophysics (I did my master in [this group](https://www.tat.physik.uni-tuebingen.de/~kokkotas/Welcome.html))
* web development
* open source
