# Hey, I'm Roman ðŸ‘‹

I am a PhD student in the departement of physics at the University of ZÃ¼rich. My research interests revolve around probabilistic modelling in medical physics (radiation oncology mostly).

<!--- Later this year, I will publish a paper on the probabilistic model of lymphatic metastatic spread and you can find the respective code here as well -->
